Difficulties: I wanted to make so that mario collect the coins and kept the amount but I was unable to do that.
The coin png was inserted in to the map but it wasn't collectable but I got it so that he was able to jump on it, to manuver around.

Coding is difficult and time consuming but once you get it done properly it really lighten.
Enjoy trying to write a mini game.
Overall the code still works just some it is user controlled and everything loaded.
