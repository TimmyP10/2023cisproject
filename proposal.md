# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Mario Jumper

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

The project is video game. It consist of Mario jumping through different obstacle, for everyone that he passes he will gain 1 point and it will keep adding on.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

So this will be done using python, also with Pygames. This game will allow the user to play and enjoy. It will have a background of where the place is taken. The game will be user controlled which mean 
when the person decide to jump its up to them. So time and keypress is everything to achieve high score.  

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

Don't plan on combine final project.

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

None

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

The program works as in will will run even if not perfect.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

I think accomplish the program running with everything well.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

I hope to achieve everything that I summarize. Everything is organized and ready to play.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

I have rarely use pygames, so I might look into it and learn more information. The game might be repetitive so, I might try to find a way that will make the user not get boring.
Probably like adding prize they get will reach a certain point. Skills for coding video games. Connecting pygames to python so that it could run and load.
