#### What have you done for your project so far?

Having a background and sprite for the game. Being able to control the character.

I haven't create the obstacle so that if the player touches it, they will die and will be ask if they want to play the game again while keeping their highest score.

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

So far, i haven't face any obstacle yet, hope I could make it run without errors.
